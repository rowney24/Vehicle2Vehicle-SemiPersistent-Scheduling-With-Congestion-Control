# Vehicle2Vehicle-SemiPersistent-Scheduling-With-Congestion-Control
- This is a code in MATLAB for my undergraduate thesis. I have made some tweaks to it afterwards so that it is not exactly what my undergrad thesis focused on.
- Using this code without permission is probitted (plagiarism is not a cool thing). The code is public only for people who are fascinated by how I simulated my undergrad thesis using MATLAB.
- You can view and get an idea but you may not copy and paste as is.
